# Security Headers Examples
A few boilerplate examples of setting security headers in your application.

These examples are not meant as a one size fits all but a good starting point to get up and running with security headers and start applying them in your projects. I will be adding to these examples as time goes on with new variations and in different programming languages.

## Current Examples
- .htaccess for Apache configurations
- JS file for AWS LambdaEdge
